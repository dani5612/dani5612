### Hello there!
(it was supposed to be a star wars reference! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:)
### This is your local, below the average, computer science student :yum:

This semester I am learning about culture and laws related to the internet, operating systems, cybersecurity, principles of programming languages and being introduced to software engineering

I am also using some of my free time to create games using Unity. At the moment I am barely starting, but I plan get a couple of small mini games by March. From there I will be learning to use Unreal Engine, take a course in artificial intelligence and finally I'll try modeling and animating using blender. 

It is a lot! but persistence is the key :smile:



:scroll: I am always happy to meet new people and make new friends! If you ever wanna chat, feel free to message me using discord! (dani_5612#5612)

(Se habla espa√±ol :wink:)
